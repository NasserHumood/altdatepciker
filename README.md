# Experimental NONFUNCTINAL Code to: An alternative Date Picker

Steps to get this done:
- Selecting a month and desplaying a 7*6 grid. ( done )
- Switching between months.
- a different view to when the user clicks on the month's name above to quickly toggle between months and years.
- after a date is selected with a button click, the selected date gets injected into an input field maybe

when all of this is done, I should have a functional beta ^
then maybe add these:
 - if a date is selected and the component is called again, we open the month of the selected date.
 - Ranges ?
 - min and max ?
 - functional reset button
